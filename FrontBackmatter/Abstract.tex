%problem
Nutrient pollution of waterbodies is a major worldwide water quality problem. Excessive use and discharge of nutrients can lead to eutrophication and algal blooms in fresh and marine waters, resulting in environmental problems associated with hypoxia, public health issues related to the release of toxins, and freshwater scarcity. 
%Surveys reveal that eutrophication is a global problem, reporting that 54\% of lakes in Asia, 53\% in Europe, 48\% in North America, 41\% in South America, and 28\% in Africa are affected by eutrophication.
Agricultural activities are one of the main contributors to anthropogenic nutrient releases. Focusing on the livestock industry, the nutrient releases, mainly phhosphorus and nitrogen, result from the production of large amounts of organic waste.  While for animals on pasture, organic waste should not be a source of concern if stocking rates are not excessive, for concentrated animal feeding operÂ­ations (CAFOs) manure should be properly managed due to the high rates and spatial concentration of the organic waste generated.
