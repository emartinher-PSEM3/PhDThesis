Unfortunately, for economic and logistics reasons, most manure tends to be applied to soils near where it is generated. Over time P concentrations in soils where dairy manure is applied builds up, often in excess of crop demands, and its potential loss in runoff poses a risk to water quality. We previously described, and have subsequently built, a full-scale version of a MAnure PHosphorus EXtraction (MAPHEX) System capable of removing greater than 90\% of the P from manures. While originally designed to remove phosphorus, we postulated that the MAPHEX System was also capable of removing odor and microbes, and of concentrating alkalinity into a solid, economically transported form. In this study the MAPHEX System was shown to be highly versatile at removing greater than 90\% of the phosphorus from a wide range of dairy manures. In addition, the study showed that the System is also capable of concentrating and recovering alkalinity from manures, while also removing over 80\% of microbes and reducing the odor of the effluent applied to fields by half.},

	abstract = {Lowering the phosphorus (P) content of animal manure is one approach of addressing concerns over surplus P accumulation in soils resulting from land application of animal manure. We sought to develop a treatment system for liquid manures that conserves manure nitrogen (N) while removing most of the manure P. Initial evaluation of a treatment system involving manure solid separation and precipitation of dissolved P with an alkaline salt (Ca(OH)2) resulted in poor liquid/solid separation and poor dissolved P removal and created conditions promoting ammonia-N (NH3-N) volatilization. As a result, we developed a three-stage system with iterative solid removal and acid salt (ferric sulfate –Fe2(SO4)3) sorption of dissolved P: (1) removal of bulk and intermediate sized solids ({\textgreater}25 μm); (2) chemical treatment to convert dissolved P; and (3) final removal of fine solids and chemically sorbed P. When tested on manure slurries from 150 and 2700 cow dairies, 96\% to 99\% aqua regia extractable P was removed along with 92\% to 94\% of the solids, resulting in liquid manure filtrates with N:P ratios greater than 19:1. While costs of treatment were roughly \$38 kg-1 P removed, equivalent to \$750 cow-1 yr-1, we anticipate that refinement of the process and beneficial uses of the solid materials (bedding, compost, etc.) will improve cost-efficacy considerably.},

abstract = "Nutrient pollution from livestock waste impacts both fresh and marine coastal waters. Harmful algae blooms (HABs) are a common ecosystem-level response to such pollution that is detrimental to both aquatic life and human health and that generates economic losses (e.g., property values and lost tourism). Waste treatment and management technologies are not well established practices due, in part, to the difficulty to attribute economic value to associated social and environmental impacts of nutrient pollution. In this work, we propose a computational framework to quantify the economic impacts of HABs. We demonstrate the advantage of quantifying these impacts through a case study on livestock waste management in the Upper Yahara watershed region (in the state of Wisconsin, USA). Our analysis reveals that every excess kilogram of phosphorus runoff from livestock waste results in total economic losses of 74.5 USD. Furthermore, we use a coordinated market analysis to demonstrate that this economic impact provides a strong enough incentive to activate a nutrient management and valorization market that can help balance phosphorus within the study area. The proposed framework can help state, tribes, and federal regulatory agencies develop regulatory and non-regulatory policies to mitigate the impacts of nutrient pollution."
