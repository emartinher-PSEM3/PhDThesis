	abstract = {Animal manure contains nutrients [primarily nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)] and organic material that are beneficial to crops. Unfortunately, for economic and logistics reasons, most manure tends to be applied to soils near where it is generated. Over time P concentrations in soils where dairy manure is applied builds up, often in excess of crop demands, and its potential loss in runoff poses a risk to water quality. We previously described, and have subsequently built, a full-scale version of a MAnure PHosphorus EXtraction (MAPHEX) System capable of removing greater than 90\% of the P from manures. While originally designed to remove phosphorus, we postulated that the MAPHEX System was also capable of removing odor and microbes, and of concentrating alkalinity into a solid, economically transported form. In this study the MAPHEX System was shown to be highly versatile at removing greater than 90\% of the phosphorus from a wide range of dairy manures. In addition, the study showed that the System is also capable of concentrating and recovering alkalinity from manures, while also removing over 80\% of microbes and reducing the odor of the effluent applied to fields by half.},

	abstract = {Lowering the phosphorus (P) content of animal manure is one approach of addressing concerns over surplus P accumulation in soils resulting from land application of animal manure. We sought to develop a treatment system for liquid manures that conserves manure nitrogen (N) while removing most of the manure P. Initial evaluation of a treatment system involving manure solid separation and precipitation of dissolved P with an alkaline salt (Ca(OH)2) resulted in poor liquid/solid separation and poor dissolved P removal and created conditions promoting ammonia-N (NH3-N) volatilization. As a result, we developed a three-stage system with iterative solid removal and acid salt (ferric sulfate –Fe2(SO4)3) sorption of dissolved P: (1) removal of bulk and intermediate sized solids ({\textgreater}25 μm); (2) chemical treatment to convert dissolved P; and (3) final removal of fine solids and chemically sorbed P. When tested on manure slurries from 150 and 2700 cow dairies, 96\% to 99\% aqua regia extractable P was removed along with 92\% to 94\% of the solids, resulting in liquid manure filtrates with N:P ratios greater than 19:1. While costs of treatment were roughly \$38 kg-1 P removed, equivalent to \$750 cow-1 yr-1, we anticipate that refinement of the process and beneficial uses of the solid materials (bedding, compost, etc.) will improve cost-efficacy considerably.},

The ﬁrst step toward restoration of eutrophicated water bodies is a marked reduction of nutrient loadings in their drainage basins. However, the combination of a number of physical and socio-economic factors is now producing compounded increases in nutrient loads while the nutrient assimilation capacities of natural systems are decreasing. Meanwhile, most of the lakes in densely populated part of China are shallow and very susceptible to anthropogenic alteration. Therefore, in spite of ascending efforts in eutrophication control upward trends of algal blooms in both fresh and coastal waters have been observed for the past two decades. Huge knowledge gap exists in our understanding of the sources and pathways of nutrient losses to aquatic ecosystems. Successful water quality restoration of China’s eutrophic waters relies not only on more resource input but also more emphasis on basic, integrated, and management-oriented research.},

In this paper, we propose an approach based on stochastic multi-criteria acceptability analysis (SMAA) to effectively manage the multi-criteria project portfolio selection and scheduling problem. This SMAA-based approach has two main procedures. First, a backtracking algorithm is proposed to find all satisfactory portfolios. Second, the SMAA is conducted to evaluate satisfactory portfolios and help decision makers select the optimal portfolio. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the SMAA-based approach.},

	abstract = {Food production requires application of fertilizers containing phosphorus, nitrogen and potassium on agricultural ﬁelds in order to sustain crop yields. However modern agriculture is dependent on phosphorus derived from phosphate rock, which is a non-renewable resource and current global reserves may be depleted in 50–100 years. While phosphorus demand is projected to increase, the expected global peak in phosphorus production is predicted to occur around 2030. The exact timing of peak phosphorus production might be disputed, however it is widely acknowledged within the fertilizer industry that the quality of remaining phosphate rock is decreasing and production costs are increasing. Yet future access to phosphorus receives little or no international attention. This paper puts forward the case for including long-term phosphorus scarcity on the priority agenda for global food security. Opportunities for recovering phosphorus and reducing demand are also addressed together with institutional challenges.},

	abstract = {Lowering the phosphorus (P) content of animal manure is one approach of addressing concerns over surplus P accumulation in soils resulting from land application of animal manure. We sought to develop a treatment system for liquid manures that conserves manure nitrogen (N) while removing most of the manure P. Initial evaluation of a treatment system involving manure solid separation and precipitation of dissolved P with an alkaline salt (Ca(OH)2) resulted in poor liquid/solid separation and poor dissolved P removal and created conditions promoting ammonia-N (NH3-N) volatilization. As a result, we developed a three-stage system with iterative solid removal and acid salt (ferric sulfate –Fe2(SO4)3) sorption of dissolved P: (1) removal of bulk and intermediate sized solids ({\textgreater}25 μm); (2) chemical treatment to convert dissolved P; and (3) final removal of fine solids and chemically sorbed P. When tested on manure slurries from 150 and 2700 cow dairies, 96\% to 99\% aqua regia extractable P was removed along with 92\% to 94\% of the solids, resulting in liquid manure filtrates with N:P ratios greater than 19:1. While costs of treatment were roughly \$38 kg-1 P removed, equivalent to \$750 cow-1 yr-1, we anticipate that refinement of the process and beneficial uses of the solid materials (bedding, compost, etc.) will improve cost-efficacy considerably.},

  abstract = {Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior are classified as oligotrophic lakes on the basis of their biological, chemical, and physical characteristics. Lake Ontario, although rich in nutrients, is morphometrically oligotrophic or mesotrophic because of its large area of deep water. Lake Erie, the most productive of the lakes and the shallowest, is eutrophic. Several changes commonly associated with eutrophication in small lakes have been observed in the Great Lakes. These changes apparently reflect accelerated eutrophication in the Great Lakes due to man’s activity. Chemical data compiled from a number of sources, dating as early as 1854, indicate a progressive increase in the concentrations of various major ions and total dissolved solids in all of the lakes except Lake Superior. The plankton has changed somewhat in Lake Michigan and the plankton, benthos, and fish populations of Lake Erie are greatly different today from those of the past. An extensive area of hypolimnetic water of Lake Erie has developed low dissolved oxygen concentrations in late summer within recent years.}
