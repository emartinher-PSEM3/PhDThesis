\section{Scope and objectives of the thesis}
\subsection{Main objective}
This thesis seeks to promote the recovery and recycling of nutrients contained in livestock waste by identifying the most appropriate technologies for phosphorus and nitrogen recovery at cattle and swine CAFOs, assessing the potential nutrient releases abatement that could be achieved by the deployment of these systems and analyzing incentive policies for their effective implementation at livestock facilities. Moreover, we introduce a systematic framework for evaluating and selecting the most suitable nutrient recovery system at CAFOs considering geospatial environmental vulnerability to nutrient pollution. 

\subsection{Specific objectives}
\paragraph{Objective I:} To
%perform a review of the state-of-the-art of the processes for phosphorus and nitrogen recovery from livestock waste, 
identify the role of intensive farming activities on nutrient pollution, including the main sources of nutrient releases, as well as potential processes and systems for nutrient recovery.
\paragraph{Objective II:} To identify environmental indicators for nutrient pollution, and use  them to  assess the potential for the abatement of phosphorus releases by deploying the processes previously selected at livestock facilities at subbasin spatial resolution.
\paragraph{Objective III:} To develop a decision-support system for the evaluation and selection of nutrient recovery systems at livestock facilities integrating techno-economic data of the nutrient recovery technologies and environmental vulnerability to nutrient pollution information determined through a tailored geographic information system (GIS) in order to select  the most suitable system for each particular livestock facility.
\paragraph{Objective IV:} To design and analyze potential incentive policies for the deployment of phosphorus recovery technologies at livestock facilities, as well as to study the fair allocation of limited monetary resources.
